# roadE event planner project

## Lets plan your next event! 

With our app you can easily search for events that you would like to go to. 

roadE is a fully responsive webpage with user interactability. We allow you to search and filter for events by location, genre, and more!

To help keep track of your interests we have also implemented a search history of your last 8 searches, to quickly take you back to what you were looking for!

Once you have found an event that you're interested in, click on it to view more details in our modals, featuring the forecast for the day, an image of the event, dates and times for the event, and a URL where you can buy tickets if they are still available!
